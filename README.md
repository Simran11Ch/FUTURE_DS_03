# FUTURE_DS_03
üìò Student Exam Analysis Project - README
üìÇ Project Overview
This project explores student performance data using Python (Jupyter Notebook) for data analysis and modeling, and a Power BI dashboard for interactive visualization. The goal is to uncover patterns in student scores based on factors like gender, parental education, test preparation, and sports activity.

üß† Project Components
1. student_analysis.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook)
Performs the following:

Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, type conversions.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and descriptive stats for math, reading, and writing scores.

Feature Analysis: Examines the effect of gender, test prep, and parental education.

Modeling (if applicable): Trains and evaluates ML models to predict scores or classify performance levels.

2. student_analysis_dashboard.png (Power BI Dashboard)
Visual Highlights:

Average scores: Math (66.72), Reading (69.54), Writing (68.61).

Gender-based score distribution and comparisons.

Score analysis by:

Parental education

Test preparation course

Sports practice

Useful for stakeholders who prefer visual insights over raw data or code.

3. Recording_student_analysis.mp4
A recorded walkthrough of the dashboard, explaining key insights and how to interpret each visual component.

üîç Key Insights
Test Prep Works: Students completing test prep score significantly higher.

Parental Education Matters: Children of more educated parents tend to perform better.

Gender Trends: Females generally outperform males in reading and writing.

Sports Involvement: May have a mild effect on performance, needs further analysis.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries
Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Power BI: For dashboard creation

Jupyter Notebook: For exploratory and predictive analytics

üì¶ How to Use
Run the Notebook to explore and preprocess the data, and view custom plots.

View the Dashboard (.png) for visual summary or watch the video walkthrough (.mp4).

Use insights for academic strategy, curriculum planning, or data-driven education policy.
